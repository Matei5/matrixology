# Matrixology

## Task Requirements

Create an interactive project using an LED matrix and Arduino that demonstrates:

* Menu based navigation
* Joystick input
* Real time game logic
* Persistent data stored in EEPROM
* Use of sensors for gameplay interaction

The project must run on physical hardware and show correct behavior across all modes.

## Project Description

Matrixology is an Arduino based game system built around an 8x8 LED matrix and a 16x2 LCD.

It includes:

* A menu driven interface
* A roguelike game mode
* A drawing mode
* A light sensor based ability
* High score storage using EEPROM

The player uses a joystick to navigate menus, move in the game, and interact with modes.
Covering a photoresistor triggers a special ability during gameplay.
